    "**Why use a framework?**\n",
    "We could implement neural networks using numpy. However, using packages such as PyTorch make it a lot easier as they have built-in functions. As you have seen in previous tutorials we train our models using gradient descent. Ideally we want to be able to create new models and automatically compute the gradients. This is what PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks give us that makes them so appealing, they reduce computing gradients to a simple function call!!\n",

    "Below, we'll introduce you to some basic PyTorch operations. For those of you who are curious, the documentation can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html). If you're stuck, we recommend just searching what you want to do in the documentation.\n",
